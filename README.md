## 1:Student Grade Generator
The first function runs the student grade generator.You input the number at "gradeGenerator();" and console log it. The function runs the argument using if...else and outputs the grade a student should get,which are as follows: num is less than 79 return 'A' num is less than 79 but greater than or equal to 60 return 'B' num is less than 60 but greater than or equal to 49 return 'C' num is less than 49 but greater than or equal to 40 return 'D' num is less than 40 but greater than or eqaul to 0 return 'E'
Any other input and the result will be;'Please input a number'

## 2:Speed Detector
The first function performs a number of operations.It takes in the speed and if the speed limit is not reached the the output is 'Ok.'.If the value goes above 70(the speed limit),it subtracts the limit from the speed and divides by 5. It then prints out the output as the point value.(The value is rounded up by 'Math.ceil()'if a decimal is involved) The second function is a callback function and takes in a function as the argument.If point(from the fuction) is greater than 12, it outputs 'License suspended.' but if the limit is not reached, then output is the callback function.
